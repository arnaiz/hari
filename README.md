hari

config files on my current personal laptop hostnamed hari

Thinkpad x270.

I customize this simple and usable installation tin my personal laptop. Is a minimal Devuan Beowulf desktop over a crypted LVM volume. I added dpkg -l output to show intalled packages.

To gain usability added an auto_login option with my username and password to the LighDM display manager. I consider users password its not neccesary since its a single user host and at boot sequence decrypt fs password its required.
